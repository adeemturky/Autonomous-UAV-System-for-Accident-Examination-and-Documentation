# Autonomous-UAV-System-for-Accident-Examination-and-Documentation

# Project Description
In the first stage, YOLO detects and classifies damages, providing their coordinates for accurate identification.
The second stage converts these results into a clear, human-readable format. A Large Language Model (LLM) is used to generate a detailed report describing the damages and their characteristics.
